        Organ Donor Coverage: The policy indemnifies the medical expenses for the organ donor's hospitalization for the purpose of harvesting the organ, provided the organ is for an insured person and the donation complies with the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994.
        
        No Claim Discount: A No Claim Discount of 5% on the base premium is offered on renewal for a one-year policy term if no claims were made in the preceding year. The maximum aggregate NCD is capped at 5% of the total base premium.

        AYUSH Coverage: The policy covers medical expenses for inpatient treatment under Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy systems up to the Sum Insured limit, provided the treatment is taken in an AYUSH Hospital.
        
        Room Rent and ICU Limits: For Plan A, the daily room rent is capped at 1% of the Sum Insured, and ICU charges are capped at 2% of the Sum Insured. These limits do not apply if the treatment is for a listed procedure in a Preferred Provider Network (PPN).
